| Issues | Reasons | Person working on the issue | JUnit Test Scenario (See Test Scenario table for details) |Code Bug-Free (See Code Bug Free Table for details) | Meaningful Javadoc comments for each public method | Junit Test for Each Public Method | Schedule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jabref [Empty entry in JabRef leads to Error when compiling in LaTeX](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/8096) | This is important because users could run into this issue fairly commonly. Adding the feature of the confirmation dialog helps remind users of any empty entries they may have added accidentally and forgotten to delete. This avoids potential errors users may run into when compiling in LaTex if their JabRef library has empty entries. | Anna Qian (ruoyuq2) | Wrote test scenario (Test ID: confirmEmptyEntries) <p>Please see the first entry in Table Test Scenario  for details.</p> | Yes, I used both Spotbugs and PMD to check my code. <p>Please see the first entry in Table Code Bug-Free for details.</p> | Yes, added Javadoc comment for the added public method: hasEmptyEntries() in BibDatabaseContext.java | Yes, created [unit tests](https://github.com/ruoyu-qian/jabref/blob/6e19d11001b4eb106db18d992a9a9dd61a5aa782/src/test/java/org/jabref/model/database/BibDatabaseTest.java) for the added public method: hasEmptyEntries(). <p>Since this is a GUI feature, I did use case tests as well. Please see the column ‘Results After Fixing the Issue’ of the first entry in Table Test Scenario for details. | [PR](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/8218) **merged**<p></p><p>**Week 10/25- 10/31:**</p><p>Comfiled Jabref using IntelliJ internal build. Reproduced the error and wrote a test scenario for the error.</p><p></p><p>**Week 11/1- 11/7:**</p><p>Understood the code structure of Jabref and implemented my solution.</p><p></p><p>**Week 11/8- 11/14:**</p><p>Submitted PR and worked with the developers to improve my solution. Eventually, my PR was merged.</p> |
|Jabref <p>[The directory pattern is not considered when checking if a file can be moved](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/7908) </p>|Fixing this bug is important to enhance good user experience. Right now, if users have set the default directory pattern for linked files, they cannot move linked files in the way it is supposed to work. |Anna Qian <p>(ruoyuq2) </p>|Wrote test scenario (Test ID: considerDirectoryPatternWhenMovingFiles) <p>Please see the second entry in **Table Test Scenario**  for details. </p>|Yes, I used both Spotbugs and PMD to check my code.  <p>Please see the second entry in **Table Code Bug-Free** for details. </p>|Yes, <p>added Javadoc comment for the added public method: </p><p>equals() in FileHelper.java </p>|Not yet, but will work on this next week. <p>But I have done use case tests since this is a GUI feature. Please see the column ‘Results <u>After Fixing</u> the Issue’ of the second entry in **Table Test Scenario** for details. </p>|[PR](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/8244) **drafted**<p></p><p>**Week 11/8-11/14:** </p><p>Reproduced the issue and wrote a test scenario. </p><p>**Week 11/15-11/21:** </p><p>Implemented my solution to solve the issue and drafted PR. </p><p><u>Next steps:</u> </p><p>**Week 11/22- 11/28:** Write Junit test for newly added public method, modify existing unit tests that would be impacted by my implementation. Submit PR for review. </p><p>**Week 11/29-12/5:** Work with the engineers to improve my solution and hopefully merge the PR. </p>|
|Jabref <p>[Invalid DOI should not show "Connection error"](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/8127) </p>|The user might encounter this issue frequently since that the issue is related to the basic feature of Jabref.  <p>Many other issues all depend on/related to this issue.  </p><p>E.g., issue https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/526 is related to this issue. </p>|Jie (jzheng5) |Wrote the test scenario (Test ID: removeInvalidDOICharacter) <p>See the **Table Test Scenario**  for details. </p>|Yes <p>Please see [Invalid DOI should not show "Connection error"](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/8127) entry in **Table Code Bug-Free** for details. </p>|Yes  <p>added Javadoc comment for the added public method: </p><p>removeScharDOI(String doiStr) </p>|Yes. <p>Created junit tests for the added public method: </p><p>removeScharDOI(String doiStr) </p><p>I also did the user test and please find details in the **removeInvalidDOICharacter** entry of **Table Test Scenario**. </p>|**[PR](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/8215): submitted** but got **closed** because another pull request submitted got selected. <p>**[Issue](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/8127): closed.** ![](MDAttachments/Picture1.png) </p>|
|Jabref <p>[Exception when pasting an entry with a publication date-range of the form 1910/1917](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/7864) </p>|This issue is important because that 1910/1917 is a valid biblatex format and commonly used in a lot of books, proceedings, collections, ...  |Jie (jzheng5) |Wrote the test scenario (Test ID: parseDateRange) <p>See the **Table Test Scenario**  for details. </p>|Yes <p>Please see [Exception when pasting an entry with a publication date-range of the form 1910/1917](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/7864) entry in **Table Code Bug-Free** for details. </p>|Yes  <p>added Javadoc comment for all modifications. </p>|N/A, because this is a GUI enhancement to support date range and I only made modifications to existing methods. <p>I also did the user test and please find details in the **parseDateRange** entry of **Table Test Scenario**. </p>|**[PR](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/8247): submitted**, waiting for reviewer’s feedback. <p>11/20 - 12/10 modify the code based on reviewers’ feedback. </p>|
|Jabref <p>[DOI link: opens in preview and causes an exception](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/7706) </p>|This is an issue that is important to users using the preview pane as they would expect: seeing a hyperlink should allow you to open a link without error.  |Evan Pickett <p>(evandp3) </p>|See the Test Scenario table below for details |Yes |N/A (no new public method) |N/A (no new public method) |**[PR](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/8255) merged** <p>11/01-11/05 </p><p>Took some time to figure out project setup and codebase </p><p>11/08-11/12 </p><p>Researched and wrote up solution </p><p>11/20 </p><p>Code merged </p>|
|Jabref <p>[Stuck in creating library entry after Fetcher 'DOI' did not find an entry](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/7870) </p>|This is an issue that can lead to hanging in the program, which is an important problem to fix.  |Evan Pickett (evandp3) |In Progress |In Progress |In Progress |In Progress |Schedule: <p>11/22-11/26 </p><p>Identify issues and write solution in code </p><p>11/29-12/3 submit PR </p>|

|Jabref <p>[Empty entry in JabRef leads to Error when compiling in LaTeX](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/8096)  </p>|Anna Qian <p>(ruoyuq2) </p>|confirmEmptyEntries |**Precondition:**  <p>1. Open JabRef </p><p>2. Open an existing JabRef library or create a new JabRef library </p><p>**Steps to Reproduce:** </p><p>1. Click the ‘New entry’ icon and select ‘Article’ </p><p>2. Save and close the library in JabRef. </p><p>3. Open the saved library (.bib file) - an empty entry has been generated as below: </p><p>@Article{, </p><p>} </p><p>**Isolation:** </p><p>1. This happens to both mac and linux OS (Ubuntu 20.04) </p><p>2. This also happens with all other 18 types of entries. </p>|After my implementation, if users want to close a JabRef library with empty entries in it, a confirmation window will pop up: <p>![](MDAttachments/Picture2.png) </p><p>If the user chooses ‘Delete empty entries’, any empty entries will be removed before closing. If the user chooses ‘Keep empty entries’, empty entries will be kept. If the user chooses ‘’Return to JabRef’, then it will go back to the editing window. </p>|Empty entries were saved without asking. <p>  </p>|
